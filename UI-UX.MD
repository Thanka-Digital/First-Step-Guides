# UI / UX

`UI/UX` is one of the most important steps that is required to create not only beautiful but also easy to use and inspiring products.

Being one of the first step towwards any digital product ranging from website to mobile applications it is crucial to have some rules that will overlook the design here at **Thanka Digital**.

**Rules (Rather things to remember)**

1. Align items/elements perfectly. Including alignment between items and alignment between item and overall screen both horizontally and vertically.
2. Consistency is the key to better UI as well as UX. So try to keep consistency in most part of the design (like typography, colors, spacing, and more)
3. Use of icons should be consistent by using same type of icon through out the design.
4. For bigger scope projects follow the following steps:

   1. Create wireframes for each page before designing the page
   2. After creating certain amount of pages do a audit of the design so far and create groups of following:

      - All used font (family, weight, sizes)
      - All used colors (there hex and hsl code, even the once with different opacity)
      - Icons used in the project
      - Spacing between elements (horizontal and vertical)

   3. Using the audited resources create a `Design System`.
   4. Create components that will be reused have have different variants.
   5. Create design with the use of the design system and component.
   6. Document the different components and design so fellow designers and developers can easily understand what to use, when to use and how to use.

> [!TIP]

> For documentation we will provide you with a template that can be used to easily create documentation for each component and element from your design.
