# Working with open source projects

When working with `open source projects` built at Thanka Digital (such as [beej](https://github.com/thanka-digital/beej-monorepo)) you need to **Fork** the project into your own personal account then work in the forked repo before sending Pull requests to the main repo.

**Steps**

1. Fork the repository
2. Follow the [git branching pattern](https://github.com/Thanka-Digital/First-Step-Guides/blob/main/GIT-%26-GITHUB.MD#branching-for-open-source-projects)
3. Write your magics into the code
4. Send a PR to the repo's recommended **branch**

> [!Note]
>
> Do read through the **Contribution and Code of conduct** guide of the repository before sending any PR's to the project
